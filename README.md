					---------- CellTypeClassifier ----------


Kilosort/phy generated units supervised and unsupervised classification, with the hope to sort them by cell type.

Kilosort: https://github.com/cortex-lab/KiloSort (M. Pachitariu, Kwikteam)
Phy: https://github.com/kwikteam/phy (C. Rossant, Kwikteam)


This module contains two scripts:

1) FeaturesExtraction.py

	This script gathers the routines to extract kilosort/phy (kwikteam) generated units features,
stored in an instance of DataManager():
 - Sampling rate (30Khz)
 - Spike times in sample units
 - Spikes times in seconds
 - Spikes clusters, cluster corresponding to each spike of Spike times
 - Clusters indexes, array of the cluster indexes (one occurence of each)
 - attributed Spike times and Spike samples, lists of n_clusters np arrays of the form [[cluster_idx1, t1, t2...tn], ...] with t1... in seconds or samples
 - Instantaneous Firing rate, lists of n_clusters np arrays of the form [[cluster_idx1, IFR1, IFR2...IFRn], ...]
 - CrossCorrelograms between units
 - Vizualisation tool


>> How to use it: <<
	Store this script in the folder which also contains the 1) params.py file 2) spike_times.npy file and 3) spike_clusters.npy file,
all being generated by kilosort and exploited/modified by phy (kikteam).
	Then launch python or ipython from any terminal, and "import FeaturesExtraction". Here it is, you can instanciate DataManager by doing "data = DataManager()".
	Then visualize the Mean Firing Rate, the Instantaneous Firing Rate and the auto/cross correlograms of units thanks to the visualization() method.

2) FeaturesExploitation_Classifier.py

	This script allows to use a scikit-learn.org classifier (supervised or unsupervised),
in order to sort kilosort/phy generated units according to their cell type
using their features, extracted thanks to the DataManager class written in FeaturesExtraction.py.
